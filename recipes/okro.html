    <h1> Okro and Tomatos</h1>

    <h1> Description</h1>
    
    <p>Okra seems to be quite divisive: folks either love it or they hate it! 
        This mild green fruit (yes, we treat it like a vegetable, but it’s actually a 
        fruit) that has a unique grassy flavor — somewhat similar to eggplant or green beans 
        — thrives in hot and humid climates, making it a staple in Southern cuisine.</p>
    
        <p>This dish, which is adapted from Paula Deen’s okra and tomatoes recipe, has been a favorite around here for years. 
        I’ve tweaked the original over time, landing on what we deem to be the best version of this 
        Southern classic. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Okra </li>
        <li> Tomatoes </li>
        <li> Bacon </li>
        <li> Vidalia onion </li>
        <li> Garlic, thyme, bay leaf, salt and pepper</li>
        <li> Apple cider vinegar </li>
        <li> Sugar </li>
        <li> Worcestershire sauce </li>
       
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet or Dutch oven for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and garlic, cooking for about 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomatoes, sugar, thyme, bay leaf, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li>Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the okra, cover with a lid, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the okra is tender.
             This takes about 10-12 minutes for fresh okra or about 7-8 minutes for frozen okra.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Taste and season with salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve and enjoy!</li>
